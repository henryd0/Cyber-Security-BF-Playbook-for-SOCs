This playbooks is on brute force authentication attempts. The attacks can be against internal or Internet facing systems.
Detection
SIEM alerts on number of failed authentication attempts.
Related alerts from IPS and other security devices.
Verification
Check if the logon was successful or not.
Confirm if the targeted account(s) exist or not.
Check the attack source IP:
confirm it is an internal host or external
confirm owner / user of the source IP (if possible)
Communication
If the attack is successful, escalate to security / risk management team and relevant IT support teams and discuss mitigation strategy. Inform the relevant account owner(s) on the password compromise and necessary reset.
If the attacker is an internal IP, check with the owner / administrator to understand any recent action may have caused this. (e.g. downloaded software from Internet)
For failed attacks report / escalate according to a pre-agreed threshold (e.g. based on number of accounts affected, number of attacks, etc).
Action
If the attack is successful, reset passwords of all compromised accounts immediately. Treat target host(s) as compromised and follow playbook #1. Extra care must be taken if the concerned account is an administrator account, where an in-depth investigation will be needed on the impact and containment actions required.
If the attacker IP is internal, assume it is compromised and execute playbook #1.
If the attacker is on the Internet, block the source IP on the network perimeter. You may consider to report it to the IP / AS owner on their abuse contact.
